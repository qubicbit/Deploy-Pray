        </div><h3>It all began with massive machines like ENIAC, early computers that filled entire rooms yet, by modern standards, had less power than a basic calculator from the 1990s. During World War II, pioneers such as Alan Turing helped lay the theoretical and practical foundations of computing through their work on codebreaking and machine logic.
As computers evolved, so did the need for them to communicate with one another. In the late 1960s, the ARPANET project demonstrated how computers at different locations could exchange data, laying the foundation for what would eventually become the Internet. Over time, this network of networks grew beyond research and military use.
A major breakthrough came at CERN in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, making it possible to access and share information easily over the Internet. By the mid-1990s, the Web had moved beyond researchers and hobbyists to become part of everyday life.
Today, information is available instantly, and websites shape how we learn, work, and communicate. This book introduces HTML—the language that forms the backbone of the World Wide Web—and shows how simple markup is used to create the pages that connect the modern world.
